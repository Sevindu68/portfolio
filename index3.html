                <h2>As a Member of <span>Astronomy Club</span>....</h2>
                <p>"Since 2022, I have been actively involved in the University of 
                    Kelaniya Astronomy Club, where I have dedicated my time and effort to various astronomical endeavors. 
                    During my tenure, I have contributed to organizing and participating in stargazing events, where we've brought 
                    the wonders of the night sky to fellow students and the local community. Additionally, 
                    I have worked on promoting astronomy education by conducting workshops and presentations to ignite a
                    passion for the cosmos among our members. Collaborating with the club's members, I've also engaged in astronomical 
                    research projects, deepening our understanding of celestial phenomena. My commitment to the University of Kelaniya Astronomy 
                    Club has allowed me to blend my love for astronomy with a passion for sharing the marvels of the universe with others."</p>

                    Kelaniya's Software Engineering Students Association (SESA). My role within the association has 
                    involved multifaceted contributions. I've actively participated in event planning and execution, 
                    helping organize coding competitions, workshops, and seminars to bolster the technical skills and knowledge of our members.
                    Additionally, I've played a pivotal role in facilitating effective communication within the association, ensuring that 
                    information flows smoothly among members and leadership. My commitment to SESA reflects my passion for fostering a vibrant 
                    community of software engineering students, 
                    and I've been instrumental in helping our organization thrive and achieve its goals.."</p>
